Laps is a plugin that **shows performance information** about WordPress page load.

It provides a visual summary in toolbar that is quick and easy to inspect.

## Page profiling

Laps automatically tracks many events, such as:
- PHP, core, plugins, and themes load, main posts loop, sidebars
- database queries (with [`SAVEQUERIES` defined constant set to true](https://wordpress.org/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/#save-queries-for-analysis))
- network requests to other sites 

## API profiling

For Ajax and REST API — Laps outputs performance information by Server Timing API, for use with clients such as Chrome Dev Tools.

### API authentication

API requests need to be authenticated as admin for performance data to be sent. For Ajax requests cookies are sufficient. REST API requests also [need nonce passed](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/#cookie-authentication).

`laps_can_see` check can be filtered to relax required permissions on the plugin’s side.
